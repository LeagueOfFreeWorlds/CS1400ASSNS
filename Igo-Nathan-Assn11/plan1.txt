#Requirements:
The program is a simulation of a strange species called "Orbians". When first ran,
the program will display a title menu:
"WELCOME TO ORBIAN FAMILY"
From there, the user has to hit the Enter key (or really any key) to start the orbian
creation menu. The menu is a list of 7 options for the user to choose:
1. "Meet Orbian Family"
    User has the option to see a list of all of the Orbians with their respective
    names.

2. "Compare Orbians"
    User has the option to compare one Orbian's size (volume) with another.

3. "Orbian Info"
    User has the option to see the size (volume), height, and age of their Orbians.

4.  "Create Orbian Baby"
    User has the option to append a new Orbian to the Orbian family by taking the
    characteristics of one Orbian parent, and another.

5. "Send to Pasture"
    User has the option to "retire" an Orbian to a pasture, thereby removing it
    from the list of Orbians within the family.

6. "Orbian Thanos"
    User has the option to kill 50% of the Orbian family population. This option
    will randomly select 50% of the Orbians and remove them from the list.

7. "Quit"
    Program ends.

The menu will continue to print so long as the user has not chosen to quit the
program.

## Analysis:
The program is comprised of two files that run the program. The main file (task1.py)
is responsible for printing the menu, getting user inputs, and displaying results
that the user wants to see. The orbian.py file contains all of the functions and
characteristics of Orbian objects. This includes name, volume, radius and height.
