"Gronky" Program
# Requirements:
The program is a basic card dealer that gives the user a desired amount of 
cards that they want, shuffled. The cards are also not a standard deck of 
52 cards, as they are instead a unique cardset called 'Gronky,' which
consists of 107 cards, with 17 ranks instead of the typical 13, and with 7 
suits, instead of the typical 4. Furthermore, instead of being called the 
usual "ranks" and "suits," they are called "Titles" and "Gangs."

The program has to be able to shuffle the deck of 107 unique cards, and then
draw the desired amount of cards the user wants to the console. The program
also has to be able to tell the user if they want to have the cards 
reshuffled, or if they wish to quit once they've finished with shuffling.

## Analysis:
The program consists of four files:
    card.py
        - Class that stores all of the card attributes, such as title and
          gang affiliation
    deck.py
        - Class that contains function for the deck that performs shuffling
          of the cards.
    cardmap.py
        - Contains all of the card titles and gangs. 
    main.py (task3.py):
        - Main part of the program that the user interfaces with.
