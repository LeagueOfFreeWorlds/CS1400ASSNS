# Fluky numbers program
## Requirements:
Fluky numbers are random numbers generated on an interval of 0 to 10, including the start 
and endpoint values. Fluky numbers also share one of the same factors as 10 (2, 5), and therefore,
the program needs to find numbers that share those factors within the randomly generated set. Value set contains 10,000 integers, of which there are an unknown amount of fluky numbers. 
## Analysis:
Program needs to store randomly generated set of 10,000 integers within an array, along with a seed
value to test the program's ability to process the exact same generated set every time. 10,000 was a requirement set for the program, and thus the amount that is generated.
