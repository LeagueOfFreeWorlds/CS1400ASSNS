# Requirements:
The program generates a pyramid structure of numbers, based on how the user enters how many
rows that they want to have for the pyramid. The larger the number of columns, the
greater the size of the pyramid. The program has to increase the number of columns for
every next row, in order to give the appearance of a pyramid structure.
The only thing the program should ask for, is just for the number of rows the user wants.
From there, the program has to generate a pyramid with the desired amount of rows that
the user inputted.
## Analysis and design:
Program utilizes for loops in order to print pyramid pattern to console. This is done by first calculating the amount
of spaces needed at the beginning in order to fit the bottom rows.
The spacing calculation ensures that the bottom row has one or more spaces from the edge of the console. The number of rows
increases in length by about 2 every other time. Subtracting 2 makes it easier to indent for larger number values later
on in the program, as digits >9 have a major offset from the rest of the pyramid.

Once row as been indented, second for loop prints the value of the row based on i value of for loop that it's nested in.
Final operation within the for loop checks if the value of the row exceeds 9, to which case the program changes over to
using a larger spacing constant to better indent the larger digits to the rest of the pyramid.
## Testing:
Program has been tested to work with the following row sizes: 1, 2, 6, 12, 15, 20, 40, 50
Since program has had no errors and meets the requirements without issues, it is functional.
