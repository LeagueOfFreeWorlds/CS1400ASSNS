# Requirements:
The program is a sort of pet simulation, where the user can create a new pet,
called "blobbers" that have a name, a color, and have to be fed in order to
remain alive. During first startup, the program has to print a menu that
allows the user to set name, color, and size of their blobber.
# Design:
The blobber's initial health, or "happiness", is determinate on the volume it
was given at creation. Blobbers are cylindrical creatures, so the larger the
radius and height, the more health that the blobber has.
If the user doesn't take care to feed the blobber properly, such as
the blobber being malnourished (happiness <90%) or overfed (happiness >110%),
the blobber will immediately turn to dust. The blobber's health status is
heavily dependant on the progression of time. Every second, the blobber's
health decrements by 0.02%, making it so that the user has to continue to
feed their blobber before it perishes.
The name and color of the blobber can also be changed at anytime from within
the menu
